    abstract = "{DNA variation analysis has become indispensable in many aspects of modern biomedicine, most prominently in the comparison of normal and tumor samples. Thousands of samples are collected in local sequencing efforts and public databases requiring highly scalable, portable, and automated workflows for streamlined processing. Here, we present nf-core/sarek 3, a well-established, comprehensive variant calling and annotation pipeline for germline and somatic samples. It is suitable for any genome with a known reference. We present a full rewrite of the original pipeline showing a significant reduction of storage requirements by using the CRAM format and runtime by increasing intra-sample parallelization. Both are leading to a 70\\% cost reduction in commercial clouds enabling users to do large-scale and cross-platform data analysis while keeping costs and CO2 emissions low. The code is available at https://nf-co.re/sarek.}",

    abstract={TogoVar (https://togovar.org) is a database that integrates allele frequencies derived from Japanese populations and provides annotations for variant interpretation. First, a scheme to reanalyze individual-level genome sequence data deposited in the Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA), a controlled-access database, was established to make allele frequencies publicly available. As more Japanese individual-level genome sequence data are deposited in JGA, the sample size employed in TogoVar is expected to increase, contributing to genetic study as reference data for Japanese populations. Second, public datasets of Japanese and non-Japanese populations were integrated into TogoVar to easily compare allele frequencies in Japanese and other populations. Each variant detected in Japanese populations was assigned a TogoVar ID as a permanent identifier. Third, these variants were annotated with molecular consequence, pathogenicity, and literature information for interpreting and prioritizing variants. Here, we introduce the newly developed TogoVar database that compares allele frequencies among Japanese and non-Japanese populations and describes the integrated annotations.},

    abstract = "The Japanese archipelago is a terminal location for human migration, and the contemporary Japanese people represent a
    unique population whose genomic diversity has been shaped by
    multiple migrations from Eurasia. We analyzed the genomic characteristics that define the genetic makeup of the modern Japanese population from a population genetics perspective from the genomic data of 9,287 samples obtained by high-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) by the National Center Biobank         Network. The dataset comprised populations from the Ryukyu      Islands and other parts of the Japanese archipelago (Hondo). The Hondo population underwent two episodes of population decline during the Jomon period, corresponding to the Late Neolithic, and the Edo period, corresponding to the Early Modern era, while the Ryukyu population experienced a population decline during the shell midden period of the Late Neolithic in this region. Haplotype analysis suggested increased allele frequencies for genes related to alcohol and fatty acid metabolism, which were reported as loci that had experienced positive natural selection. Two genes related to alcohol metabolism were found to be 12,500 years out of phase with the time when they began to increase in the allele frequency; this finding indicates that the genomic diversity of Japanese people has been shaped by events closely related to agriculture and food production.",

We describe here a novel assembly-based approach to variant calling, the GATK HaplotypeCaller (HC) and Reference Confidence Model (RCM), that determines genotype likelihoods independently per-sample but performs joint calling across all samples within a project simultaneously. We show by calling over 90,000 samples from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) that, in contrast to other algorithms, the HC-RCM scales efficiently to very large sample sizes without loss in accuracy; and that the accuracy of indel variant calling is superior in comparison to other algorithms. More importantly, the HC-RCM produces a fully squared-off matrix of genotypes across all samples at every genomic position being investigated. The HC-RCM is a novel, scalable, assembly-based algorithm with abundant applications for population genetics and clinical studies.},
